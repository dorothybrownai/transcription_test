  "question": "Which of the following is a correct representation of a lambda function in Python that calculates the square of its input?",
  "options": [
    "lambda x: x * x",
    "lambda x, y: x ** 2 + y ** 2",
    "def square(x): return x * x",
    "lambda: x * x"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "lambda x: x * x",
  "explanation": "Lambda functions in Python, also known as anonymous functions, are small anonymous functions defined using the 'lambda' keyword. They take any number of arguments but consist of only a single expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Unlike normal functions, lambda functions do not require 'def' and 'return' statements, making them a concise way to define small functions for immediate use in certain contexts."
