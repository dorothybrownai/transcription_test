    "question": "What is the purpose of type annotations in Python, as mentioned in the context?",
    "options": [
        "A) They automatically enforce variable types at runtime.",
        "B) They provide a way to document the expected data types of variables and functions.",
        "C) They define constants in Python that cannot be changed.",
        "D) They increase the execution speed of the program."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Type annotations in Python are used to document the expected data types of variables and functions. They serve as a helpful guide for developers, allowing code editors to generate warnings if the provided types do not match expected types, thus helping prevent errors. However, type annotations do not enforce type checking at runtime; the program will still run regardless of whether the annotations are adhered to. They are essentially a developer tool and not a security feature, much like a traffic light that serves a guiding function but does not physically stop a car from going through a red light."
