    "question": "What is the purpose of type annotations in Python?",
    "explanation": "Type annotations provide a way for developers to indicate the expected data types of variables and function return types. They serve as an optional tool for documentation and error checking within a code editor, allowing the developer to catch potential type-related mistakes before runtime. Although type annotations do not affect the execution of the code itself, they improve code readability and maintainability. For instance, specifying that a variable 'age' has an integer type helps clarify the programmer's intent and serves as a guideline for others reading the code, although the program will run without enforcing these types."
